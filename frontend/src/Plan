Steps:
1. Get one website's API and be able to get the cheapest flight from that website from one search
 - https://www.expedia.ca/Flights-Search?flight-type=on&mode=search&trip=roundtrip&leg1=from%3AToronto+%28YYZ+-+Pearson+Intl.%29%2Cto%3AMontreal+%28YMQ+-+All+Airports%29%2Cdeparture%3A20%2F04%2F2022TANYT&options=cabinclass%3Aeconomy&leg2=from%3AMontreal+%28YMQ+-+All+Airports%29%2Cto%3AToronto+%28YYZ+-+Pearson+Intl.%29%2Cdeparture%3A23%2F04%2F2022TANYT&passengers=children%3A0%2Cadults%3A1%2Cseniors%3A0%2Cinfantinlap%3AY&fromDate=20%2F04%2F2022&toDate=23%2F04%2F2022&d1=2022-04-20&d2=2022-04-23
 - I think ^ in the body of the reqeust you can see the cheapest flight
2. Create a simple search form such as the one in Expedia where one can search for
  - Flying from --> Flying to
  - Start date is a RANGE
  - End date is a RANGE
  and when user click on enter be able to use that information to send an API request to the single API we got in step 1

Step two is challengin because the API might not simply take in the name of a destination, it might take in coordinates or
another format. The date format is also very important here as the API might take the dates in very different formats, need
to keep an eye out for this and most likely will need to create a class with a lot of different functions that trasnlate the inputs to different formats depending on the API we are sending the data to.

Another difficulty is the mapping, similar to above challenge, we might need to have a dictionary of mapping between say a destination and its coordinates or another value such as its short form ie. Canada --> CAD etc.
